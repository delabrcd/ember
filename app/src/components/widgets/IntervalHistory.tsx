// The interval HISTORY widget (issue #121 part 2; WS2 UX rework): a self-contained
// dashboard tile showing the historical smart-meter reads over time. Unlike the
// load-shape widget (which shows an AVERAGE DAY profile), this widget plots the
// actual timeline so the user can see usage trends, daily patterns, and gaps.
//
// SELF-FETCHING (deliberately contained): like IntervalLoadShape, this widget owns
// its own data. On mount (and whenever the fuel, the selected account, or the
// window changes) it fetches /api/interval and draws the result with Recharts. It
// does NOT touch the ChartSpec/ConfigurableChart seam.
//
// SERVER-PICKED RESOLUTION (WS1 + WS2). The widget no longer chooses a 1h/15m
// grain. WS1 moved ALL resolution logic to the server: /api/interval picks the
// bucket width from the requested [from, to] window (chooseBucket), SUMS energy
// into those buckets in SQL (energy is additive), and — when the window is small
// enough to fall in the 15-min band — returns a uniform 15-min grid. The response
// carries `grain` (the chosen bucket in SECONDS), `fifteenMinFrom` (the earliest
// 15-min timestamp for this fuel/account, or null), and `downsampled` (whether
// finer detail exists than what's returned). So WS2's client:
//   • renders the server `rows` DIRECTLY — no client reconcile, filter, or
//     downsample; a thin map (toHistoryPoints) to {label, ts, value} is all.
//   • has ONE energy line per fuel (the Resolution 1h/15m toggle is GONE).
//   • labels the resolution from the numeric `grain` (formatGrain).
//
// CONTROLS:
//   • Fuel: Electric | Gas  (the only toggle now)
//
// RANGE (issue #36): the widget follows the GLOBAL RangeControl, receiving the
// resolved `from`/`to` ISO day bounds as props and fetching
// /api/interval?fuel=…&from=…&to=… (it no longer sends `grain`). The server bounds
// the series to ≤ MAX_POINTS regardless of how wide the range is.
//
// ZOOM (issue #141): on TOP of the global range, the user narrows into a sub-span
// LOCALLY by DRAG-SELECTING a band across the chart, without mutating the global
// RangeControl. We listen to the Recharts LineChart mouse handlers: onMouseDown
// records the start x, onMouseMove (while dragging) updates the current x, onMouseUp
// commits. The in-progress band is a <ReferenceArea>. On commit the two selected x
// positions map to their points' ts and become the zoom window; we refetch
// /api/interval for just that span — a narrower window → the server picks a FINER
// grain (e.g. the 15-min grid), so zooming literally trades range for resolution.
//
// WHY DRAG-SELECT, NOT A BRUSH: a Recharts <Brush> handle sub-selects the loaded
// data; when a narrow drag refetched finer data the handle had nothing left to
// sub-select and reset to full width ("snap back to the start"). A drag-select has
// no persistent handle, so nothing can snap — each drag commits a new zoom + refetch.
//
// "END OF 15-MIN DATA" MARKER (WS2): when the response's `fifteenMinFrom` falls
// inside the visible window AND the fuel is Electric (there is no 15-min GAS data),
// we draw a <ReferenceLine> at that x. Left of it the line is coarser (hourly, or
// the grid's quarter-steps); the marker tells the user "this is where true 15-min
// detail begins" so the flatter left side reads as lower resolution, not as a data
// problem. Out-of-window or null fifteenMinFrom, or Gas → no marker.
//
// STALE-WHILE-REVALIDATE — NEVER COLD-BLANK (WS2): historically a base reload
// (fuel/range/account change) blanked the whole chart to the pulse skeleton. Now,
// once there is ANY data on screen, a reload KEEPS the prior chart visible and
// overlays a subtle "updating" shimmer while the new response loads, then swaps the
// rows in place. Only the very first load (nothing cached, nothing on screen) shows
// the skeleton. A small client SWR cache (lib/intervalCache.ts) backs this: the
// widget paints the last-seen series for the new key INSTANTLY from cache (if warm)
// while revalidating, so a fuel-toggle / range-change feels instant. The `alive`
// stale-response guard still prevents an out-of-order response from overwriting a
// newer one.
//
// GAPS: connectNulls={false} is load-bearing — missing intervals (the API omits
// them) render as line BREAKS, NEVER as fabricated zeros. The server returns gaps
// as absent rows; toHistoryPoints keeps them absent.
//
// MOUSE NAVIGATION (WS5): on TOP of the drag-select zoom, the chart supports
// FOCUSED mouse navigation — gestures that engage ONLY while the chart is focused:
//   • Click the chart body → focus it (a subtle amber focus ring appears). Click
//     OUTSIDE, or press Esc, releases focus. The wheel/pan gestures below are live
//     ONLY while focused.
//   • Wheel up/down → zoom IN/OUT centered on the time under the cursor (the window
//     contracts/expands around the cursor's data point; ~12% per notch). The wheel
//     is captured (page-scroll prevented) ONLY while focused, so scrolling past an
//     UNfocused chart never gets trapped.
//   • Shift+wheel → pan the window left/right (~12% of the span per notch).
//   • Ctrl+drag → grab-and-pan the viewport horizontally (the window moves OPPOSITE
//     the drag, like grabbing the plot). A PLAIN drag (no Ctrl) stays the existing
//     zoom-SELECT band — WS5 does not touch that path.
// All the WINDOW MATH is the PURE zoomWindowAroundCenter / panWindow in
// lib/intervalZoom.ts (hand-calc unit-tested); this component is only the impure
// shell: focus tracking, the native non-passive wheel listener (React onWheel is
// passive and can't preventDefault), Ctrl/hover tracking via refs, and a DEBOUNCED
// refetch so a flurry of wheel ticks coalesces into ONE /api/interval request.
//
// The gesture window is expressed in epoch-MS and clamped to the global
// [from, to] window (never zoom out past it, never pan outside it, never below the
// 1-hour MIN_ZOOM_SPAN_MS floor). When a zoom-out reaches the full global window we
// CLEAR the local zoom (equivalent to Reset; the "Reset zoom" affordance hides).
// The display window (`zoom`) updates IMMEDIATELY for responsiveness; the actual
// fetch window (`fetchZoom`) is a debounced copy so rapid ticks don't spam the route.

// WS6 makes the data swap-in feel SMOOTH instead of a snap. A navigation gesture
// (wheel-zoom / shift-pan / ctrl-drag / drag-zoom-select / reset) updates the live
// display window immediately, then the DEBOUNCED refetch swaps a new point-set in;
// historically that swap was instant (`isAnimationActive={false}`) so the line path
// JUMPED. We now let Recharts TWEEN the <Line> path between the old and new point
// sets for nav-driven swaps: Recharts interpolates the SVG path `d` over
// `animationDuration` with the named easing, so the line glides to its new shape.
//
// WHY THIS DOESN'T REINTRODUCE FLICKER / COLD-BLANK: the WS2 SWR layer already keeps
// the PRIOR chart on screen during a refetch (never setState(undefined) once there's
// data), so the morph animates the swap of an already-present line, not a blank→line
// fade. We animate ONLY on nav-driven updates (the `animateNext` flag, set true the
// instant a gesture fires and consumed by the next render), and explicitly DON'T
// animate the genuine first load nor the base reloads (fuel/range/account) — those
// keep `isAnimationActive={false}` so there's no mount-time grow-in flicker.
//
// DURATION is kept SHORT (one wheel notch settles fast and the debounce is 150ms) so
// rapid ticks don't stack visibly-fighting animations: the displayed window updates
// live per-tick, but the line only re-animates on the SETTLED (debounced) data swap,
// so at most one morph plays per coalesced refetch. ease-out reads as a quick glide
